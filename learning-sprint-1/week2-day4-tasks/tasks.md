For this task, you need to complete the full section of Object Oriented
Programming in FreeCodeCamp.com. Pictured below:

üìå **IMPORTANT NOTE: To be able to continue this task, you need to have an account
on FreeCodeCamp.**

If you don't already have an account, go ahead and sign up from
[here](https://auth.freecodecamp.org/u/signup/identifier?state=hKFo2SA2OVlFWXpCbWdlN3o3MzBpTWxjZjk1bWItOE1faVI2b6Fur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIGd2REJTNEkwZFMzSHhpUmV3dkh6VUxjT0RxNkpSYmdZo2NpZNkgYVVEdjlqVnFUZnhCUkUxbDYwTkE1QWY3eVRDR0U0Y3k). 

After you sign up and log in, go to the [JavaScript Data Structures and
Algorithms
curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)
and solve all 26 exercises of the Object Oriented Programming section.

Since 26 exercises are too many to be documented in github, we're allowing you
to show us your progress on FCC instead.üñ•Ô∏è

In order to make your progress visible on FCC & share it with us, do the following steps:

- At the top-right of your screen, there's a menu button. Click on it. Then
select **Settings**. 
- Scroll down until you reach the **Privacy Settings** section. 
- Under the **Privacy Settings** section, set **My Profile** and **My Timeline**
to be **Public** instead of **Private** as pictured below.üîí
- Save your new changes. Without saving, your new changes won't get applied. 
- To check if your progress is public, click on the menu button on the top-right
  of your screen and select **Profile**.
- Now copy the URL of your profile page.
- Open either another browser, or an incognito window on your current browser.
- Paste the URL on the new window/browser and click enter. See if you can see
  your own progress or not. It should look something like the screenshot below. 
- Now copy the link again, and paste it in this
  [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JOo_Wqq1tCmrdUjaIRrl-olY0t6SV9RoUXUPoWPvF0Y/edit?usp=sharing)
  beside your name.üìù

That's it! you're done! üéâüòÑ
